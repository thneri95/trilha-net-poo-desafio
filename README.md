# 📱 C# Smartphone Abstraction Project

> 🚀 A console-based C# application designed to showcase the power and elegance of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles — **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** — through a fun and practical simulation involving smartphones from **Nokia** and **iPhone**.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This project was developed as part of the **OOP module** within the [DIO - Digital Innovation One .NET Track](https://www.dio.me/).

It demonstrates how abstract modeling and class hierarchies can be applied to represent real-world objects (smartphones) and their behavior differences while sharing a common base structure

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Apply core **OOP concepts** in a clean and testable way
- ✅ Use an **abstract base class (`Smartphone`)** to enforce consistent structure
- ✅ Implement **brand-specific logic** via concrete classes: `Nokia` and `Iphone`
- ✅ Promote **code reuse**, **readability**, and **flexibility**

## 🧪 Sample Output

```plaintext

Testing Nokia Smartphone:
Calling...
Receiving call...

-------------------------------------------

Testing iPhone Smartphone:
Calling...
Receiving call...
Installing the application "Instagram" on your iPhone
Installing the application "WhatsApp" on your iPhone
iPhone Info - Number: 9876-5432, Model: iPhone 15 Pro, IMEI: 999888777, Memory: 256GB


OOP Concepts Demonstrated

💡 Concept	           ✅ Description
Abstraction           	Defines a shared contract via Smartphone, hiding internal implementation
Inheritance	            Nokia and Iphone inherit from the Smartphone base class
Polymorphism	        Each smartphone overrides InstallApplication() with brand-specific logic
